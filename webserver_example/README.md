# Webserver example

This is a more elaborate example that shows how to embedd a webserver in Autodesk Revit and use it to automate tasks.

How do you access the BIM from outside Revit? With the Revit API it is rather easy to access the outside world from *within* Revit, but say you wanted to write a shell script that needed to read a schedule from a .rvt document - how would you go about that?

Wellâ€¦ one way would be to have Revit act as a web server, say, http://localhost:8080. You could then use curl:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/schedules/my_schedule_name.csv > my_local_file_name.csv
```

Let us build a script that allows you to do just that: Export any schedule in the BIM as a .csv file. We'll architect it so that you can add a .tsv (tab separated values) output or even a .xls version if you like. And then you can go wild with other outputs - like a screenshot of the current view (think `curl http://localhost:8080/screenshot`) or ways to open / close documents etc.

This is a variation on the non-modal dialog issue (FIXME: link to jeremy tammiks blog) - we want to run a web server in a separate thread, but have

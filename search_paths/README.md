# Search Paths

You can use the *Search Paths* tab of the *Configure Commands* dialog to specify additional locations that will be searched when importing modules.

The *Add* button opens a dialog that lets you choose a folder to add. You can edit the selected folder either with the text box or by clicking *Browse...* and choosing a new folder. Use the *Remove* button to remove an entry in the search paths list.

The search paths will be written to the configuration file (FIXME: link to chapter) when the *Configure Commands* dialog is closed with *Save* - clicking *Cancel* will undo any changes you made.

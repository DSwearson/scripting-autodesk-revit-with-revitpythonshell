# Files and Locations

FIXME: move this to an appendix as most people won't care about this!

Create a list of all the files installed with RevitPythonShell. Also, a list of files (generally) created by RPS. Add a glossary for terms used here. Find a canonical way to refer to "canned commands" (external scripts, analog to `ExternalCommand`)

The RevitPythonShell installer creates the following folders:

* the *application folder* 
  * defaults to `C:\Program Files (x86)\RevitPythonShell2015` on most systems
  * note: the `2015` portion means that this is the version for Autodesk Revit 2015 - other versions will differ accordingly
* the *data folder*

# Creating the Installer

Your installer will need to create a Revit addin manifest file (FIXME: check what Revit actually calls these files) and place it in the appropriate directory. See the Revit documentation on how to actually do this. Below is an example template of such an addin manifest:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" standalone="no"?>
<RevitAddIns>
  <AddIn Type="Application">
    <Name>YOUR_ADDIN_NAME</Name>
    <Assembly>C:\PATH\TO\YOUR\ADDIN\ASSEMBLY</Assembly>
    <AddInId>GENERATE_AND_INSERT_GUID_HERE</AddInId>
    <FullClassName>YOUR_ADDIN_NAME</FullClassName>
    <VendorId>REGISTER_YOUR_VENDOR_ID</VendorId>
  </AddIn>
</RevitAddIns>
````
You can call the AddIn whatever you like. The `FullClassName` should be the same as the basename of the RpsAddin manifest file - that is what the class generated by DeployRpsAddin is called.

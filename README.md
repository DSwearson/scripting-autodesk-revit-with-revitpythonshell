The RevitPythonShell exposes the Revit API to the Python programming language. And to keep with the spirit of Python, it includes a REPL (Read Evaluate Print Loop), the interactive shell that let's you try out code snippets *inside* a running Autodesk Revit instance! This offers a totally new way to create addins for Revit and Vasari with a more hands-on experience.

Features:

* Python language scripting (IronPython)
* Syntax highlighting
* full access to the Revit API
* export RevitPythonShell scripts as standalone-addins
* 


Brainstorming chapters / sections:

* including python libraries
* InitScript with src attribute
* can we have multiple StartupScripts?
* interactive non-modal REPL
* sample scripts from the SDK? go through them one at a time
* in fact: new goal: every friday, try out some new piece of API and blog it?
* Close Revit from the API (in StartupScript e.g.)

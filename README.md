Brainstorming chapters / sections:

* including python libraries
* InitScript with src attribute
* can we have multiple StartupScripts?
* interactive non-modal REPL
* sample scripts from the SDK? go through them one at a time
* in fact: new goal: every friday, try out some new piece of API and blog it?
* Close Revit from the API (in StartupScript e.g.)
